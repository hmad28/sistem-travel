# AGENTS.md

This file guides AI agents working on Hammad Tour OS. Read it before making code changes.

## Project Identity

Hammad Tour OS is a multi-tenant website, CMS, and internal management system for Indonesian Umrah and Hajj travel businesses. It is built from the MIT-licensed ForgeStart foundation and follows the Travel Umroh OS technical blueprint.

The public demo name is `Hammad Tour` with `Powered by Hammad Studio` attribution. Do not expose ForgeStart or generic starter text in user-facing code.

## Current Stack

- Next.js 16 App Router with React 19.
- TypeScript with strict project-wide checking.
- Auth.js v5 with JWT sessions.
- PostgreSQL as the only supported database.
- Drizzle ORM and Drizzle Kit as the only database layer.
- shadcn/ui, Base UI primitives, Lucide icons and Tailwind CSS 4 for UI.
- next-intl for localization with `tr` and `en`.
- pnpm 10.
- Neon PostgreSQL for production and optional Docker PostgreSQL for local development.
- Vitest, React Testing Library and Playwright for verification.

Important entry points:

- `app/layout.tsx` loads locale messages and system theme.
- `app/(protected)/layout.tsx` defines the authenticated shell.
- `auth.ts` defines Auth.js behavior.
- `proxy.ts` is the Next.js 16 middleware replacement.
- `db/schema/` is the database source of truth — one file per table (e.g. `db/schema/users.ts`), with shared enums and the `timestamps` helper in `db/schema/_shared.ts`, all `relations()` in `db/schema/relations.ts`, and a barrel re-export in `db/schema/index.ts`. Always import via `@/db/schema`, never reach into individual files from outside the schema folder.
- `db/seed.ts` owns base RBAC, settings and super admin data.
- `db/reset.ts` drops both `public` and `drizzle` schemas, migrates and seeds.
- `scripts/docker-dev.mjs` is legacy local tooling; production remains Vercel serverless.
- `env.ts` is the single zod-validated source of truth for environment variables; modules import `env` from it instead of reading `process.env` directly.

## Development Workflow

Prefer this setup for local development:

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install
pnpm setup
pnpm dev
```

`pnpm setup` creates `.env` from `.env.example` and generates a 32+ character `AUTH_SECRET` and a random `SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD`. Use Neon for shared development and production. Docker PostgreSQL remains optional for isolated local work.

Use these verification commands:

```bash
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

For database changes, also run:

```bash
pnpm db:reset
```

For broad changes, run:

```bash
pnpm verify
```

Do not use npm or Yarn. Keep `pnpm-lock.yaml` committed.

## Database Rules

Drizzle is the only database abstraction. Do not add Knex, Prisma, raw migration frameworks, or a second ORM.

When changing database structure:

1. Edit (or add) a file under `db/schema/`. Adding a new table:
   - Create `db/schema/<table-name>.ts` with the `pgTable` definition.
   - Re-export it from `db/schema/index.ts` (group with related tables for readability).
   - If it needs a `relations()` block, add it to `db/schema/relations.ts` (never inline relations in the table file — they import from many tables and we keep that cross-cutting concern in one place to avoid circular imports).
2. Generate a migration with `pnpm db:generate`. The Drizzle Kit config (`drizzle.config.ts`) globs `./db/schema/*.ts`, so it will pick up new files automatically.
3. Review the generated SQL in `drizzle/`.
4. Update seeds in `db/seed.ts` if the base system needs new data.
5. Run `pnpm db:reset`.

`db:reset` must reset both the application schema and Drizzle's migration journal. If only `public` is dropped while `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations` remains, Drizzle can skip migration SQL and seed into missing tables.

Seed logic should be idempotent. Running `pnpm db:seed` repeatedly must not duplicate users, resources, actions, settings or permissions.

## Auth And Authorization

Auth.js v5 uses JWT sessions. User permissions are enriched through `lib/auth/session-data.ts` and checked with the shared permission model.

Server API routes should use `requireApiPermission` from `lib/auth/server-permissions.ts`. Client UI should use `usePermission` or the permission wrapper components under `components/permission/`.

Permission semantics are resource and action based. The seed includes an `ALL` resource with `*` action for super admin access. Preserve that model unless the task explicitly changes RBAC.

## Branding Rules

The default brand is Hammad Tour.

Branding defaults live in:

```text
lib/branding/constants.ts
public/brand/
```

Database-backed branding is loaded through the branding helpers and System settings. The logo setting should use the upload flow, not a plain URL-only field, because this starter already includes upload components.

If you touch brand text, search for stale strings:

```bash
rg -n "Next Starter|nextjsstarter|nextjstemplate|ForgeStarter"
```

Do not hardcode the app name in UI components when branding helpers are available.

## Localization Rules

User-facing strings should be localized through next-intl. The supported locale files are:

```text
messages/id.json
messages/en.json
```

When adding a translation key, add it to both files. Avoid swallowing missing-message problems by adding broad fallback logic unless the value is truly dynamic data from the database.

Use `getTranslations` in server components and `useTranslations` in client components. Avoid static visible English or Turkish text inside JSX unless it is developer-only code.

## UI Rules

This project is an operational starter for admin products. Keep screens dense, practical and consistent. Avoid marketing-page patterns inside the app shell.

Use existing UI primitives from `components/ui/`, app components from `components/app/`, data grid components from `components/data-grid/`, and upload components from `components/uploads/` before creating new primitives.

Use Lucide icons for recognizable icon buttons. Keep controls accessible with labels, aria text, focus states and disabled states.

Do not add nested decorative cards or large hero sections to admin workflows. Keep admin screens optimized for scanning, filtering and repeated work.

## API And Data Fetching

Use existing API response helpers from `lib/api/` and validation schemas from `lib/validation/`.

Client API wrappers belong under `lib/api/client/`. Query keys and TanStack Query hooks belong under `lib/query/`.

For protected API routes:

1. Check permission with `requireApiPermission`.
2. Validate input with Zod.
3. Return structured JSON responses.
4. Log audit events for meaningful administrative changes.

## Upload And Storage Rules

The upload model is represented by `uploads` in `db/schema/uploads.ts`. Upload helpers live under `lib/storage/`, and UI components live under `components/uploads/`.

Prefer reusing `FileDropzone`, `AvatarUploader`, `UploadPreview` and `FileList` for file workflows. Do not create a second upload abstraction for settings or branding.

Local storage is the default. S3-compatible storage is supported by configuration and should remain optional.

## Indonesian Product UX

- Default locale is `id-ID`, currency is IDR, and timezone is `Asia/Jakarta`.
- Prefer plain Indonesian task labels over technical terminology.
- Primary body text is at least 16px and controls are at least 44px high.
- Use guided steps, clear next actions, safe drafts, and role-based navigation.
- Preserve Excel/PDF and WhatsApp-friendly workflows for gradual digitalization.
- Do not introduce persistent Socket.IO assumptions; production is Vercel serverless.

## Documentation Rules

README is for humans evaluating or running the project. Keep it short, direct and current.

AGENTS.md is for AI agents and maintainers. Keep it detailed enough to prevent wrong architectural moves.

Do not document obsolete v1 behavior as an active path. If v1 is mentioned, describe it only as removed legacy context.

## Quality Bar

Before finishing a code change, run the narrowest meaningful checks. For most changes:

```bash
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
```

For logic changes:

```bash
pnpm test
```

For database changes:

```bash
pnpm db:reset
```

For frontend or route changes that affect runtime behavior:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Report any command you could not run and why.

## Things To Avoid

- Do not reintroduce Knex.
- Do not add another package manager.
- Do not hardcode user-facing strings outside locale files.
- Do not bypass the existing permission helpers.
- Do not duplicate upload logic.
- Do not treat this as a landing-page template.
- Do not overwrite user changes or clean unrelated files.
- Do not commit generated noise unless it is required for the task.
